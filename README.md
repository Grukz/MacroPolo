MacroPolo is a python module that can be used in order to automate processes.

While it supports simple mouse movement and key strokes simulation, what really makes MacroPolo different
from other macro operations libraries or programs is that it can powerfully search your screen for pixels.

This means that you can automate many tasks depending on the current color of pixels on your screen. Using
this technic, automating complex processes (like betting at a roulette game, which is not encouraged) becomes
very easy.

# Example usage

~~~ python
#!/usr/bin/env python2

from macropolo import Macro
from time import sleep

# just move the cursor to top left
Macro.move_cursor_to(1, 1)

# write a sentence
sentence = 'You look awesome!'
Macro.keyboard(sentence)

sleep(2)

# delete the sentence
for _ in range(len(sentence)):
    Macro.keyboard(['@@BackSpace'])

sleep(0.1)

# run a command
Macro.keyboard(['ls -al', '@@Return'])
~~~

Below you can see the result (on the left) of a python script using `macropolo` (on the right)

Here's another example that uses some pixel and cursor functions

![MacroPolo pixel functions](http://i.imgur.com/dH5wKeg.gif)

Most methods are `static`. The only methods that require an instance of `Macro()` are the ones that have to do with pixel searching because they use a specified search speed (like `pixel_color_in_area_counter()` etc)

# Dependencies

Run the following on a debian system to install the dependencies:

~~~ bash
sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pyatspi2
~~~

# More info

All the functions inside the module include detailed description of their functionality.

You can access this description either by opening the module file on a text editor and looking at the first
few lines of each function, or through python:

~~~ python
import macropolo
macro = macropolo.Macro()
print macro.middle_click_to.__doc__
~~~

The above outputs:
~~~
'Middle clicks the cursor to the x, y coordinates'
~~~

`interval` (`int`) the interval in milliseconds between each check

**Return values**

`pixel_index` (`int`) 0 if `for_all` is true. If `for_all` is false then `pixel_index` represents the index in `points_colors` that contain the pixel / color pair that satisfied the condition and made the function to quit

**Example usage**

```python
points_colors = [[[100, 100], '#ff0000'], [[200, 200], '#00ff00'], [[500, 500], '#0000ff']]

```


## Instance methods

### pixel_color_in_area

**Description**

_Searches for a pixel with a specific color in an area of the screen._

_Note that this function is 100% accurate and will return the 1st occurrence only with a pixel search speed of 1. See more at [set_pixel_search_speed](#set_pixel_search_speed)_

**Parameters**

`rectangle` (`list`) the area of the screen to search in the format [x, y, width, height]

`color` (`string`) the HTML representation of the color to search for

**Return values**

`found` (`bool`) true if the function found a pixel with the specified color

`point` (`list`) a list with the x, y coordinates of the found pixel. If `found` is false, then `point` will be `[-1, -1]`

**Example usage**

```python
# search for a blue pixel in an area of the screen. By default the pixel search speed is 1 so we don't need to manually set it
found, point = Macro().pixel_color_in_area([0, 0, 1000, 500], '#0000ff')

# if there was a pixel, click on it
if found:
Macro.left_click_to(point[0], point[1])
```


### pixel_count_in_area

**Description**

_Count the number of occurrences of a specific color on an area of the screen. You can modify which pixels to search for with the pixel search speed._

_Note that the number of occurences will be 100% accurate only with a pixel search speed of 1. See more at [set_pixel_search_speed](#set_pixel_search_speed)_

**Parameters**

`rectangle` (`list`) the area of the screen to search in the format [x, y, width, height]

`color` (`string`) the HTML representation of the color to search for

**Return values**

`counter` (`int`) the number of occurrences of the color in the searched pixels

**Example usage**

```python
m = Macro()

# search every pixel
m.set_pixel_search_speed(1)

print 'There are', m.pixel_count_in_area([0, 0, 100, 100], '#000000'), 'black pixels in some part of the screen'
```


### set_pixel_search_speed

**Description**

_Set the search speed (aka the number of pixels to skip forward on each iteration) for functions that search for pixel colors in areas of the screen._

_Use this method when the searched color is known to be present on continuous areas of the screen, so as to speed up the search operation._

_Use with caution when the searched color is present in areas with width smaller than the pixel search speed._

_The default value of the pixel search speed is 1_

**Parameters**

`speed` (`int`) the number of pixels to add to the current pixel while searching. E.g. if speed is 3 then after reading pixel #1 it will skip to pixel #1+3 = #4, skipping 2 pixels

**Return values**

`None`

**Example usage**

```python
m = new Macro()

# set the pixel search speed to 3
m.set_pixel_search_speed(3)

# now search in the rectangle [100, 200, 500, 500] for a green pixel, skipping 2 pixels each time (searching only 1/3 of the pixels)
found, point = m.pixel_color_in_area([100, 200, 500, 500], '#00ff00')
# get the color on 100, 100
print Macro.color_of_pixel(100, 100) # #F78432 (result depends on the current color of pixel (100, 100) during runtime)
```
