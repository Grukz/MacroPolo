MacroPolo is a python module that can be used in order to automate processes.

While it supports simple mouse movement and key strokes simulation, what really makes MacroPolo different
from other macro operations libraries or programs is that it can powerfully search your screen for pixels.

This means that you can automate many tasks depending on the current color of pixels on your screen. Using
this technic, automating complex processes (like betting at a roulette game, which is not encouraged) becomes
very easy.

Example usage to get you started:

~~~ python
import macropolo
macro = macropolo.Macro()
macro.move_cursor_to(1, 1)
~~~

All the functions inside the module include detailed description of their functionality.

You can access this description either by opening the module file on a text editor and looking at the first
few lines of each function, or through python:

~~~ python
import macropolo
macro = macropolo.Macro()
macro.middle_click_to.__doc__
~~~

The above outputes:
~~~
'Middle clicks the cursor to the x, y coordinates'
~~~
